Command Line
=====

**Cling** has its own command line, which looks like any other Unix shell. The emacs-like command line editor is what we call interactive command line or interactive shell.

Once we start **Cling** it automatically includes several header files and its own runtime universe. Thus it creates the minimal environment for the user to start.



Grammar
------------

**Cling** is capable to parse everything that `Clang <https://clang.llvm.org/>`_. can do. In addition, **Cling** can parse some interpreter-specific C++ extensions.

Metaprocessor
------------

**Cling** *Metaprocessor* provides convenient and easy to use interface for changing the interpreterâ€™s internal state or for executing handy commands. **Cling** provides the following metaprocessor commands:

**syntax: .(command)**, where command is:

:code: `x filename.cxx` - loads filename and calls void filename() if defined
:code: `L library | filename.cxx` - loads library or filename.cxx
:code: `printAST` - shows the abstract syntax tree after each processed entity
:code: `I path` - adds an include path
